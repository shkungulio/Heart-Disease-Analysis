In the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, the number and type of visualizations used in a machine learning project aren't strictly defined, but best practices suggest **using visuals strategically** at each phase to enhance understanding, communication, and decision-making. Here's a phase-by-phase breakdown of **typical and suitable visualizations**, including guidance on quantity:



### **1. Business Understanding**
- **Goal:** Understand project objectives and requirements from a business perspective.
- **Visuals:**
  - Project scope diagrams
  - Stakeholder maps
  - Flowcharts or business process diagrams
- **How many?** 1–3 visuals to outline objectives, metrics, and stakeholders.



### **2. Data Understanding**
- **Goal:** Familiarize with the data, identify quality issues, discover initial insights.
- **Visuals:**
  - Histograms, bar plots, box plots (for univariate analysis)
  - Scatter plots, pair plots (for bivariate/multivariate relationships)
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Missing data matrix or heatmap
- **How many?** 5–15 depending on the dataset size and complexity. Prioritize coverage over redundancy.



### **3. Data Preparation**
- **Goal:** Clean and transform data for modeling.
- **Visuals:**
  - Before/after comparison plots of data distributions
  - Feature distributions (transformed vs original)
  - Outlier detection visuals (boxplots, z-score plots)
- **How many?** 3–10, focused on key transformations and their justifications.



### **4. Modeling**
- **Goal:** Build and evaluate models.
- **Visuals:**
  - Learning curves
  - Confusion matrix
  - ROC curves, precision-recall curves
  - Feature importance bar charts or SHAP value plots
- **How many?** 4–8 per model, depending on the type and number of models compared.



### **5. Evaluation**
- **Goal:** Assess model performance in the business context.
- **Visuals:**
  - Side-by-side performance comparison (e.g., bar plots, radar charts)
  - Cost-benefit or profit curves (if applicable)
  - KPI impact visuals
- **How many?** 2–5 focused on aligning model output with business goals.



### **6. Deployment**
- **Goal:** Put the model into production and plan for monitoring.
- **Visuals:**
  - System architecture diagrams
  - Model monitoring dashboards (drift, accuracy over time)
- **How many?** 1–3 for communication and technical planning.



### ✅ **General Guideline:**
- Total: **15–40 visuals** across the project is common.
- Focus on **clarity, purpose, and stakeholder needs**.
- Avoid visual clutter—each chart should convey a unique insight.
