### Data Understanding

#### **Data Collection**
The dataset used is the **Heart Disease** dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. It is a compilation of four databases (Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach VA), but most studies (and this project) focus primarily on the **Cleveland dataset**, which has the most complete records.

The dataset contains various features related to patients' health and demographic information. We will explore the dataset to understand its structure and relationships between variables.

#### **Data Description**
The dataset contains 14 key attributes that are either numerical or categorical. These attributes are:

  1. **age:** Age of the patient (numeric)
  2. **sex:** Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)
  3. **cp:** Chest pain type (categorical: 1-4)
  4. **trestbps:** Resting blood pressure (numeric)
  5. **chol:** Serum cholesterol (numeric)
  6. **fbs:** Fasting blood sugar (1 = true, 0 = false)
  7. **restecg:** Resting electrocardiographic results (categorical)
  8. **thalach:** Maximum heart rate achieved (numeric)
  9. **exang:** Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
  10. **oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise (numeric)
  11. **slope:** The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (categorical)
  12. **ca:** Number of major vessels (0-3, numeric)
  13. **thal:** Thalassemia (categorical: 1 = normal, 2 = fixed defect, 3 = reversible defect)
  14. **target:** Heart disease (1 = disease, 0 = no disease)  
  
> **Note:** Some fields (e.g., "ca" and "thal") may contain missing or invalid values coded as '?', which need attention during preprocessing.
  
#### **Data Dictionary**
The dataset contains **303 instances (patients)** and **14 main attributes** plus the target variable (presence or absence of heart disease).
  
|**Attribute**| **Data Type** | **Description** | **Contraints/Rules** |
|:--------------|:---------|:----------------|:---------------------|
| **`age`** | Numerical | The age of the patient in years | Range: 29 - 77 (Based on the dataset statistics) |
| **`sex`** | Categorical | The gender of the patient | Values: 1 = Male, 0 = Female |
| **`cp`** | Categorical | Type of chest pain experienced by the patient | Values: 1 = Typical angina, 2 = Atypical angina, 3 = Non-anginal pain, 4 = Asymptomatic |
| **`trestbps`** | Numerical | Resting blood pressure of the patient, measured in mmHg | Range: Typically, between 94 and 200 mmHg |
| **`chol`** | Numerical | Serum cholesterol level in mg/dl | Range: Typically, between 126 and 564 mg/dl |
| **`fbs`** | Categorical | Fasting blood sugar level > 120 mg/dl | Values: 1 = True, 0 = False |
| **`restecg`** | Categorical | Results of the patientâ€™s resting electrocardiogram | Values: 0 = Normal, 1 = ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = Probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy |
| **`thalach`** | Numerical | Maximum heart rate achieved during a stress test | Range: Typically, between 71 and 202 bpm |
| **`exang`** | Categorical | Whether the patient experiences exercise-induced angina | Values: 1 = Yes, 0 = No |
| **`oldpeak`** | Numerical | ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (an ECG measure) | Range: 0.0 to 6.2 (higher values indicate more severe abnormalities) |
| **`slope`** | Categorical | Slope of the peak exercise ST segment | Values: 1 = Upsloping, 2 = Flat, 3 = Downsloping |
| **`ca`** | Numerical | Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy | Range: 0-3 |
| **`thal`** | Categorical | Blood disorder variable related to thalassemia | Values: 3 = Normal, 6 = Fixed defect, 7 = Reversible defect |
| **`target`** | Categorical | Diagnosis of heart disease | Values: 0 = No heart disease, 1 = Presence of heart disease |

#### **Initial Data Quality Assessment**
- **Missing Values**: Some fields like `ca` and `thal` may have missing values or unknown entries ('?').
- **Data Types**: Some categorical variables are encoded numerically and will need to be interpreted correctly during analysis.
- **Class Imbalance**: Preliminary checks suggest the dataset is relatively balanced between presence and absence of disease, but this will be verified.
- **Outliers**: Numerical fields such as `chol` (cholesterol) and `trestbps` (blood pressure) may have outliers that need to be detected and considered in analysis.

### Neural Networks

**Overview:**
  
- A collection of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.
- Can model complex, non-linear relationships through deep learning.

**Advantages:**
 
- Highly flexible and capable of capturing complex patterns.
- Scales well with large datasets.
- State-of-the-art performance in fields like image and speech recognition.

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires large amounts of data and computing power.
- Difficult to interpret (black box).
- Prone to overfitting if not properly regularized.
